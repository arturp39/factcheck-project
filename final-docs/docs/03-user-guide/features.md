# Feature Walkthrough

## Feature 1: Claim verification

### Overview

Submit a textual claim and receive a verdict (true/false/mixed/unclear) with an explanation generated by Gemini using retrieved evidence.

### How to Use

1. Open https://factcheck-backend-804697237544.us-central1.run.app/
2. Enter a claim in the text area (e.g., "The city council approved the new transit plan yesterday.").
3. Click **Verify**.

**Expected Result:**
- A result page with verdict, explanation, and evidence list.

### Tips

- Keep claims concise; longer than 400 characters will be rejected.
- The system focuses on **recent news**. If there is no coverage in the indexed corpus, you may get "unclear" even for well-known facts.
